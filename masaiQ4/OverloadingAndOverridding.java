/*
	Overloading:-  1)Overloading helps in reading the program more properly, and make code understanding
		2)Method overloading is performed within class.
		3) parameter must be different.
		4)Example of compile time polymorphism.
		
	Overriding:- 1)Overriding where we can reassign the value of other method and override it of 
					change accordingly and remember to put @override
				 2)overriding comes between two classes that have IS-A (inheritance) relationship.
				 3)parameter must be same.
				 4)Example of runtime polymorphism



	Java Method Overloading example

	class OverloadingExample{  
	static int add(int a,int b)
	{return a+b;
	}  
	static int add(int a,int b,int c)
	{return a+b+c;
	}  
	}  
	
	
	Java Method Overriding example
	class Car{  
	void fast(){System.out.println(â€œOver Speeding");}  
	}  
	class hatchBack extends Car{  
	void fast(){System.out.println("Winning The Race");}  
	}
